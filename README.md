# Guitar Tabs

I'm going to push some music tabs into this repository in order to prevent me from losing them.

I know github is suppose to be use only for code but I am too lazy to use other cloud based service to store them. Besides, I am using vim to edit the tabs on command line, so it is just a command away to push it to github. 

Furthermore, the music tabs here are open to copy, distribute and enjoy by anyone with a guitar and a good music taste.
